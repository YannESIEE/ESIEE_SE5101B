TrueTime 1.5, 2007-01-04
=========================
Features added:
* Major performance improvements when using the network blocks. The simulation
  time is now linear rather than exponential in the simulated time. (The poor
  performance in previous versions was due to Matlab's memory management.)
* Two new Simulink blocks added, making it easier to develop networked
  applications. The two blocks makes it possible to send and receive network
  messages without using kernel blocks and code functions. A related new
  example is also added.
* ttDiscardMessages now returns the total number of discarded messages.
* ttGetInitArg (C++) primitive added.
* New Mote Soccer example added, showing how many nodes can be configured
  using the same init scripts and code functions.
Bugs removed:
* ttRetrieve gave a segmentation violation if ttFetch was not called properly.
* ttTryFetch did not unblock tasks that were blocked on ttPost
* ttTryPost did not unblock tasks that were blocked on ttFetch
* ttFetch: A blocked writer was never woken up.
* Segmentation violation when creating a timer using a non-existent interrupt
  handler.
* Propagation of clock drift from kernel nodes to network transmission
  schedule.
* 802.11 did not back off correctly on the first try when sensing that the 
  medium was busy.
* ttDiscardMessages did not work as expected with the wireless network.
* ttLogNow, ttLogStart and ttLogStop sometimes wrong when using clock drift.
* Switched Ethernet did not function properly

TrueTime 1.4, 2006-09-21
=========================
* Support for blocking mailboxes (ttPost, ttFetch, ttRetrieve) added.
* Support for semaphores (ttCreateSemaphore, ttTake, ttGive) added.
* ttGetData and ttSetData primitives added.
* ttAbortSimulation primitive added.
* ttDiscardUnsentMessages primitive added.
* Bug in ttwnetwork.cpp regarding probability of packet losses fixed.
* Bug in ttwnetwork.cpp regarding the number of retransmissions fixed.
* Bug in ttwnetwork.cpp and ttnetwork.cpp regarding deletion of
  temporary global variables fixed.
* Message lengths in ttSendMsg are now given in bits instead of bytes.
* Support for user defined pathloss function added to the wireless
  network block. It can only be used in the Matlab version.
* Problem reading inputs at time zero fixed.
* Major performance improvements (>100% speedup of the execution of the
  kernel block) in the Matlab version.
* New AODV routing example added.

TrueTime 1.3, 2005-06-28
=========================
* Support for Matlab 6.1 (R12.1) has been dropped.
* Added support for wireless networks.
* Added support for Dynamic Voltage Scaling by the use of ttSetKernelParameter.
* Added support for clock drift and offsets, configured in the kernel mask.
* Added support for power consumption and batteries.
* Added two new examples treating the wireless network block and power
  consumption using batteries.
* Added support for setting pre-and postdelay on a per node basis by using
  ttSetNetworkParameter.

TrueTime 1.2, 2004-10-15
=========================
* New internal data structures and a revised implementation of the 
  kernel block S-function.
* Support for Matlab 7.0 (R14), Matlab 6.5 (R13), and Matlab 6.1 (R12.1).
* MATLAB help for the TrueTime commands, try for example

  >> help ttInitKernel

* Broadcast of network messages
* Support for logging of task attributes
* Arrival hook added. Usually coincides with the release hook unless there
  is a pending job of the task when the new job is created. In that case the 
  execution of the release hook will be postponed until the job is activated 
  from the job queue. 
* Syntax of ttCreateJob has been changed. ttCreateJob always creates a 
  job at the current time. To create a job at a specific time, use a timer.
* Two new tutorial examples included, treating task synchronization and 
  deadline overrun handling.
* Several bug fixes.

TrueTime 1.13, 2003-10-23
=========================
* Changes in the network block:
  - Automatic division of messages into frames has been removed. This feature
    should be implemented by higher protocol layers in the computer nodes, if
    desired. The "Max framesize" and "Frame overhead" parameters have
    consequently been removed.
  - Switched Ethernet has been added as a network type, with new parameters
    describing the switch buffer memory.
* Bug in ttCallBlockSystem fixed
* ttmex command added

TrueTime 1.12, 2003-08-06
=========================
* Minor bug workaround for Matlab 6.1 (R12.1) added

TrueTime 1.11, 2003-06-24 
=========================
* Support for several network blocks in the same model
* Improved error-handling, fail-safe execution flag removed
* Common version for both Matlab 6.1 (R12.1) and Matlab 6.5 (R13)

TrueTime 1.1, 2003-03-28 
=========================
* Major new release, new syntax

TrueTime 1.0, 2002-07-18 
========================
* First release of TrueTime
